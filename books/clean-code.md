Clean Code
==========

#### Introduction

There are two parts to learning craftsmanship, knowledge and work :

1.	Gain the knowledge
2.	Working hard & practicing

#### Clean Code

The *only* way to make deadline, the only way to go fast, is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times

#### What is Clean Code ?

> I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the depedencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations. Clean code does one thing well ~ Bjarne Stroustrup

It is not the language makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that make the language appear simple!
