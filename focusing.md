# Rules

#### Work
- Work 6 days a week. Take a break at saturday or sunday.
- Think about the problem I want to solve. Don't give up. Don't rush things.
- Always breathe fresh air. Don't stay indoors for long. Open windows and go outside on breaks.
- If my mind wanders and avoids doing the task, take a walk and do some exercise.
- Ship early. Get feedback and iterate on it. Rinse and repeat.
- Never sit for too long.
