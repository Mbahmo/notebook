# Kakeibo

Similar to bullet journaling, kakeibo emphasizes the importance of physically writing things down — as a meditative way to process and observe your spending habits.

[Research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23804013) has proven [again](https://www.mic.com/articles/110662/science-shows-something-surprising-about-people-who-still-journal#.n0QO5ApTN) and [again](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1949-8594.1985.tb09614.x) the numerous benefits of [writing by hand](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/25/deepak-chopra-benefits-of-journaling-and-8-prompts-to-get-you-started.html): It can help you make positive changes by encouraging you to be more present and aware, while also acknowledging the triggers behind your bad habits.

You must ask yourself the following questions before purchasing any non-essential items:

- Can I live without this item?
- Based on my financial situation, can I afford it?
- Will I actually use it?
- Do I have the space for it?
- How did I come across it in the first place? (Did I see it in a magazine? Did I come across it after wandering into a gift shop out of boredom?)
- What is my emotional state in general today? (Calm? Stressed? \* Celebratory? Feeling bad about myself?)
- How do I feel about buying it? (Happy? Excited? Indifferent? And how long will this feeling last?)

How to spend more mindfully
———————

1. **Leave the item for 24 hours.** This highlights whether you genuinely want or need it. If you're still thinking about the item the next day and can afford it, then make the purchase. You'll feel a greater sense of satisfaction about your decision.
2. **Don't let "blowout sales" tempt you.** I used to be a sucker for big sales. But that often meant spending money on items I knew I wouldn't use. So for each item that you have in your basket during a sale, ask yourself whether you would buy it if it were full price.
3. **Check your bank balance regularly.** Checking your balance will help you feel more in control of your finances because it brings into focus how much money you have to spend. Now, the first thing I do every morning is check my balance. It's a scary habit to try at first, but does wonders for worry levels.
4. **Spend in cash.** Physically handing over cash rather than just mindlessly swiping your card makes you more conscious of what you're spending, and you will find it easier to budget. Try taking out a set amount of cash to use for the week and only spending what you have.
5. **Put reminders in your wallet.** My friend came up with the brilliant idea of attaching a sticker to her credit card that bluntly says, "Do you REALLY need this?!" Anything that prompts you to take a step back before making a purchase will help you make smarter decisions.
6. **Change the environments that cause you to spend.** If you notice that you often spend money after clicking on a marketing email or seeing pictures of an Instagram influencer wearing a particular brand, for example, then unsubscribe or unfollow. Or, if you buy clothes or makeup when you have time to kill, try using that time to do another activity instead, such as taking a walk in the park.
