Socioliogist **Charles Derber** describes this tendency as “conversational narcissism.” Often subtle and unconscious, it’s the desire to take over a conversation, to do most of talking, and to turn the focus of the exchange to yourself.

There are 2 responses in conversation:

-	Shift response, shifts attention back to yourself
-	Support response, supports the other person’s comment

Avoid shift response as long as you can

> We can craftily disguise our attempts to shift focus - we might start a sentence with a supportive remark and then follow up with a comment about ourselves.

But beware if you shift focus to your self repeatedly the healthy balance will go.

> The more comfortable you are the more difficult it is to empathize with suffering of another
