> At the end of the day we’re all code mongkeys trying to make weird libraries work together by writting shitty hacks

Why we have FOMOs ?

-	We doubt ourselves
-	We doubt our code
-	We focus on the wrong things
-	We obsess with the wrong metrics
-	We have a lot of free time
-	We love to procrastinate

Recognize the breaking point, when do we jump on the next thing, ask your self this 3 questions

-	How easy is the transition ?
-	Is now the right time ?
-	Do I really need it ?
