- Do push yourself, but also find a pace that’s sustainable for you in the long run.
- It’s more effective to take it in one- or two-hour chunks each day rather than in one full day each week, because you can then make a daily habit out of improving your skills.
- Human brain is optimized for processing and not for storage.

## Improve your project estimation skills

Think of estimates as a probability distributions, not best case scenarios. Instead of telling a product manager or other stakeholder that we’ll finish a feature in 6 weeks, we might instead tell them, “There’s a 50% likelihood that we can deliver the feature 4 weeks ”
