Ruby
====

```
x = "100".to_i
```

The dot means that message `to_i` is being sent to the string `"100"`. The string `"100"` is called the *receiver* of the message. We can also say that the method `to_i` being *called* on the string `"100"`. The result of method call - the integer 100 - serves as the right-hand side of the assignment to the variable `x`.
